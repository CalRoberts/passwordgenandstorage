# passwordgenandstorage

A project i'm working on that generates and stores user credentials for online services. This is just a learning project and should absolutely not be used for any real login details.

The details in the credentials text file are just test entries that I have already entered, not real passwords. 

Still need to add the encryption and decryption of the credentials file.
